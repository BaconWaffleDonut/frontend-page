This is a basic frontend page that I have been working on to use as a template for another project. There is not much to it as I did not have enough time to finish some elements of the site before High Seas ended. Eventually my goal is to create a functioning Contact Us form along with a proper About Me. I also hope to implement some small games as an easter egg at some point. Happy High Seas everyone.
